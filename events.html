            Earth is warming up, and humans are at least partially to blame. The
            causes, effects, and complexities of global warming are important to
            understand so that we can fight for the health of our planet.<br /><br />
            Global warming is the long-term warning of the planet's overall
            temperature. Though this warming trend has been going on for a long
            time, its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years
            due to the burning of fossil fuels. As the human population has
            increased, so has the volume of fossil fuels burned. Fossil fuels
            include coal, oil, and natural gas, and burning them causes what is
            known as the "greenhouse effect" in Earth's atmosphere.
